### Discussion 1

> Our lives are bathed in data: from recommendations about whom to "follow" or "friend" to data-driven autonomous vehicles.

Many people make claims like "data are everywhere." How much of this data do you
as an end user have access too? To what extent to you have access to the data
that you generate? What power dynamics are set up between data providers and
collectors?

### Discussion 2

> It has become very clear that the incentives of the organizations that build and own data products haven't aligned with the good of the people using those products.

- Brainstorm some ways that incentives could be aligned.
- People have also made the claim that "data is the new oil." Think about how
crude oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products are handled. Does how
we handle oil inform how we should handle data?

### Discussion 3

The proposed ethics checklist contains the following point:

> Do we have a mechanism for redress if people are harmed by the results?

Should it be the responsibility of a data science team to create and control
redress mechanisms?

### Discussion 4

The authors propose adapting the *andon cord* from automobile production for
data product creation. How is production on an assembly line similar and
different from production on a data science team?

### Discussion 5

> By the time a policy has been formulated and approved, it almost always lags behind technology; but itâ€™s impossible for policy makers to iterate quickly enough to catch up with the newest technology.

- Specifically, what makes this impossible?
- Should policy maker be reactive (regulate once their is a problem) or proactive
(try to anticipate problems and regulate accordingly)?
